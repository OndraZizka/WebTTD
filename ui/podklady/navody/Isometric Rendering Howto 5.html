</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">I wrote a
CRPG for my Amiga and got about 85% finished when I bought my PC and
dropped the Amiga project to learn PC programming. The point is that
while that game was/is really cool, I have learned and developed much
since then. Here's my (partial) full disclosure :)
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">This
document will cover graphics in the style of Ultima 6 (presumably
Ultima 7 as well, but I have never played it-- read on). I will also
discuss many of the same techniques that Greg Taylor covered in his
Tile-Based Games FAQ. That is one reason that I have composed this
document, because I found the information in Greg's FAQ to be somewhat
disappointing. I hope to present some ideas that will advance those he
overviewed. Granted, he covered lots of things I won't cover here (roof
tiles, hidden map areas, palette shifting), but there are so many
fundamentals that could be implemented in a better way, I had to put
out an alternate solution. Oh yeah, it is presumed that the reader has
a solid understanding of C programming.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">While Mr.
Taylor tended to emphasize the 640K barrier, I think that everyone
should get a 32-bit, protected mode compiler. Let's face it, the small
overhead of running a DOS extender with your protected mode program is
negligible in the face of the benefits gained. I feel it's a fair
assertion to assume that people who play games have at least 4 megs in
their machine. Catering to the lowest common denominator (i.e.,
286/640K) is a good thing as long as that denominator isn't too low. I
think nowadays, a 486-33/4meg is a decent denominator. The hassles of
EMS and conventional memory simply disappear when protected mode is
used. I've never been more frustrated by this situation than when I
couldn't get Ultima 7 to run on my snappy Pentium because I had to
create a boot disk and still couldn't free the conventional memory
required (without purchasing a commercial memory manager). I own U7,
but I've never played it. That kind of annoyance can be avoided by
simply using a "modern" compiler, with the added bonus that most of the
time, it will run in the increasingly popular environment, Windows 95.
(Sorry to be ranting but that's another reason I'm writing this
document :)
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Note: I am
assuming that you are interested in CRPGs since they are the most
common game genre to employ this sort of graphics. Of course, the
techniques can be applied to any game or genre (ie, a strategy game).

<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>Plotting Tiles</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">The first
task to creating a tile-based game is plotting the landscape and its
inhabitants. Well, I will assume that you have several routines
already:
</font></p><ul type="A">
<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><li>Plot a 16x16 tile, without masking (which is faster than with masking).
</li><li>Plot an arbitrarily sized tile, with masking.
</li><li>Either of the above routines with clipping (though this is optional).
</li></font></ul>

<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">I won't waste time getting
detailed about how to plot tiles, as there are many good tutorials
available on the subject (get XLib and don't worry about the nuts and
bolts of it).
</font><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>Maps and the Lay of the Land</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Greg Taylor
mentions multiple layered maps. He's absolutely right: you will need
multiple layers to get any kind of complex graphics in your world. But,
he didn't take the idea far enough.
</font></p><p><table align="right" bgcolor="#555555"><tbody><tr><td><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%205_soubory/3dimarrays.gif" alt="Three Dimensional Arrays" align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Let's look at a
typical way of implementing a map: arrays. Good ole arrays. When we all
programmed in BASIC and arrays were all we had, sure, use them for your
maps. Simply declare map[100][100] and there you have it. Want multiple
layers? Okay, map[3][100][100]. There!
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Well,
here's what I suggest. Keep the first declaration. But what we want to
achieve is massive flexibility. We don't want to be limited to 3 layers
or waste memory when we need less. (Side note: efficiency is _always_
of utmost concern! I don't care if your target platform has 32
terabytes of memory, always optimize for space and speed!) So how do we
get unlimited layers while using only as much memory as required at any
given moment?
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">About the
time you take Pascal in your CS cirriculum, they'll teach you about a
thing called a linked-list. Perhaps already you can guess what I'm
about to explain...
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">If we
define our _entire_ map as map[100][100], then for each element in that
array, we define a list header. Yep, each element is a linked-list. You
might be thinking, "But what about space optimization? Won't 10,000
linked lists be wasted memory?" Below we'll talk about ways to access
the map incrementally, which will solve this huge array problem. As it
stands, the answer to your question is still "No."
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Remember
that we had map[3][100][100], which (at minimum) is 30,000 bytes.
Granted, a linked list header may be 8 bytes itself which means
map[100][100] is 80,000 bytes. Yes, it's bigger, but even without
special techniques for accessing only part of the map at once, the
payoff in flexibility and graphic enhancement makes it worth the size.
This is another reason for using a protected mode compiler-- when you
absolutely have to, you can have these huge structures without worry of
hitting any stupid 640K limit.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Okay, so
you accept what I've said so far? Okay, then, on to the map
representation. How do we use these linked lists to achieve multiple
layers? This will require some sort of map "object" definition.
</font></p><blockquote><pre><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#000088" face="Courier New, fixedsys" size="2">
struct map_tile {
  struct map_tile  *next;   // pointer to next in list
  struct tile_gfx  *tile;   // pointer to graphic imagery object
  char             type;    // keep reading...
  char             bitflags;
};

For example:

map[0][0]
        LIST_HEADER -&gt; map_tile -&gt; map_tile -&gt; NULL<br>
map[1][0]
        LIST_HEADER -&gt; map_tile-&gt; NULL

</font></font></pre></blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">...and so on. Using
this setup, the first map_tile is the bottom-most layer in your map.
Each successive layer simply adds another map_tile to that specific map
position (ie, map element, ie, list). This way, you could stack twenty
tiles on one map position, while having only two on a tile nearby--
with no memory wasted on empty spaces! That is the big payoff for this
technique.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">I would advise that you follow some conventions.

</font></p><ol type="A">
<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">    <li>The first map_tile
in a list should be a ground layer (ie, grass, sand). It should also be
a constant 16x16 tile that should be plotted without masking. </li><li>All map_tiles after the first can be variant sized (up
to 32x32) and should be plotted with masking. These successive layers
will be trees, rocks, walls, people, monsters, swords, treasures, and
anything else.
</li></font></ol>

<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">If you're wondering how
I intend to handle a 32x32 tile in a 16x16 tile world, keep reading.
Let's get the basics down first. In fact, let's drop this for the
moment and discuss some fundamental ideas about representing NPCs and
items for a game. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>The Flesh of a Soul</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">I should
explain that I delineate objects from their graphics. That is, there
are separate structures for objects and for their graphic imagery. For
example:
</font></p><blockquote><pre><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#000088" face="Courier New, fixedsys" size="2">
struct npc_object {
     struct npc_object      *next;    // keep a pointer handy for later
     struct tile_gfx        *tile;    // pointer to the graphic imagery for this guy
     struct attributes      atts;     // str, dex, hp, inventory, etc.
     char                   x_loc;    // location on map
     char                   y_loc;    // may need to be an unsigned short if the map
                                      // is bigger than 255x255 squares
};

struct tile_gfx {
     struct tile_gfx      *next;        // always
     char                 *imagery;     // pointer to the actual bitmap data
     char                 x_size;       // size in pixels
     char                 y_size;
     char                 x_offset;     // for handling those 32x32 tiles
     char                 y_offset;
     char                 bitflags;     // 8 bitflags (ie, masked?, animated?, etc)
     char                 align;        // align to dword boundary
};

</font></font></pre></blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">So when a person or
monster is plotted to the screen, the tile information for each
character can be totally different and referenced through the NPC
structure. Likewise for items. Remember that these graphics will be
drawn with masking so that the map background can still show through.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">With this in mind, we commence with map specifics.

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>Plotting Map Layers</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">struct linked_list map[100][100];
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">This is our map definition. We have a separate linked list holding all NPCs that are active and their relevant information.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">In Ultima 6,
if a character went in a doorway, the character appeared under the
archway. The characters were further obscured by tall signs, and the
like. This is a very cool and realistic effect. (Though I haven't done
benchmarks on any of the mapping techniques here, I suspect that what
I'm building up to will require a fair amount of horsepower. Hopefully
our common denominator 486-33 will suffice.)
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">To achieve
this obscuring effect, I would flag each map_tile as either "under" or
"over" (thus, the need for the bitflags field in the map_tile
structure). The bottom layer (ground) will definitely be "under" since
all tiles get plotted over these regardless. Things like trees, walls
and open doorways should be "over" since the player could potentially
appear obscured by such objects. For best efficiency, sort all these
tile lists so that "under" tiles come before "over" tiles.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Here's how the plotting algorithm should work:

</font></p><ul>
<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">  A) Plot all ground tiles (ie, the first tile in each list).<br>
  B) Plot all tiles flagged "under."<br>
  C) Plot all NPCs and items.<br>
  D) Plot all tiles flagged "over."<br>
</font></ul>

<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">The plotting should go from upper-left to lower-right to appear correct.

</font><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>The 32 Pixel Question</b></font>
</font></p><p><table align="right" bgcolor="#555555"><tbody><tr><td><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%205_soubory/tilealign.gif" alt="32x32 Tile alignment" align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Now that the basic
map structure and function is understood (it is, isn't it?), we can get
to the 32x32 tile question. Since all tiles have a 16x16 "base"
anything over this size will simply be plotted with an offset. The
offset should force the lower-right corner of the tile to align with
the 16x16 pixel base.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">A tile that
is 20x17 would have an x_offset of -4, y_offset of -1. This is
calculated with (16 - x_size), (16 - y_size). If a tile is smaller than
16x16 (a knife, for example), then it will have a positive offset.
Look: a 7x10 tile has +8 x_offset, +6 y_offset.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">That is, unless you want to center small tiles in the 16x16 pixel space. That's easy enough.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">So now we
see how a larger tile can obscure those in adjacent locations. A very
tall tree would do this. This ain't Ultima 4 anymore! Let's get out of
the 80's technology and at least catch up to early 90's.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">With this
outline, hopefully you can exploit the possibilities yourself. Imagine
the flexibility over the "old" array technique. Instead of drawing
millions of tiles for each piece of scenery like a plain wall, another
wall with a torch on it, etc, you simply draw the plain wall, draw the
torch, then stack the picture tile on the wall tile. You can reuse the
torch for different wall types without drawing a new wall with a torch
on it. Again, this saves storage space by having fewer graphics but
with more variety.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>Material Objects and Possessions</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Handling
item objects, if you want Ultima-level technology, requires that each
object be defined in a detailed way and managed much like NPCs-- with a
linked list. This is a little more complicated, but the enrichment of
the game environment is incredible. In my Amiga implementation, for
example, I defined objects that can be moved, carried, used, contain
other objects, etc, just like Ultima 6. This allows your universes to
really come to life.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">All you
really have to do is have a main item list, call it all_items. This
list will hold each and every item that exists in your world from a
bedroll to a candle to a ration of food. It's handling this list safely
and cleanly that presents the major problem. And if you have a solid
knowledge of lists this is not much of a problem. I suggest that you
build a list library of common functions (ie, insertion, deletion,
creation, destruction) or find a library that already exists and works
reliably. Then apply these concepts.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">But now, let us aside to something else of relevance to our all_items linked list.

</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>Accessing the World Map Incrementally</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Since I've
mentioned Greg Taylor's FAQ previously, I will come to it again. He
suggests holding the entire map on disk and "paging" in only the areas
that are close by. That's exactly what I suggest. The only hairy part
is the nature of my maps. They are linked lists and this makes for a
complication when accessing them bits at a time.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">The main
barrier, then, is the storage format. How do we store a map when it's a
huge array of linked lists and link nodes? Well, there are many
possibilities. One is to encode the data with "identifier" bytes. There
are several variations of this.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">For each
map location (map[x][y]), we write to disk the number of nodes in each
list at that location (minimum 1, because we have to have a ground
tile). This is very simple. To retrieve it is the tricky part.
</font></p><ol type="A">
<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">    <li>Read one byte. If
it is zero, then we have no more nodes for the current x:y position. If
it is non-zero, we have to read that many nodes from disk, building the
list on the fly. Keep reading nodes until the Nth node is finally read.
</li><li>Repeat step A until the entire section of map we want is read into memory.
</li></font></ol>

<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">In code:

</font><blockquote><pre><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#000088" face="Courier New, fixedsys" size="2">
char c, i, x, y;
struct map_tile *mt;

x = current_x_position;              // these will probably be assigned by a loop
y = current_y_position;
while (1) {                          // loop infinitely, so be careful!

  c = fgetc(filehandle);             // read our encoding byte
  if (feof(filehandle)) break;       // end the loop, we are out of data
                                     // you'll also check to see if you've read all 
                                     // neccessary data and use break to exit the loop
  for (i=0; i&lt;&lt; c; i++) {            // read as many nodes as encoded

    mt = newnode();                  // remember to do failure checks and handle errors!
    fread(mt, sizeof(struct map_tile), 1, filehandle);
    addnode(map[x][y], mt);          // put the new node in the map lists
  }
                                     // continue reading nodes until all map data is in memory
}

</font></font></pre></blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">This code fragment
leaves out quite a bit, like list details and deciding what map
coordinate range you need to read. At least you get to see the
principles in action. There is _lots_ of linked list juggling. You must
be very, very careful about memory leaks and such when programming
this. Take your time, comment your code, and <u>know what you're doing</u>! With this sort of code, you need to plan out exactly what to do.  Some more than others, but everyone needs a plan.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Another method would require that you add two new fields to the map_tile structure:

</font></p><blockquote><pre><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#000088" face="Courier New, fixedsys" size="2">
struct map_tile {
     struct map_tile         *next;
     struct tile_gfx         *tile;
     char                    type;
     char                    bitflags;
     char                    x_loc;     // store each tile's location here
     char                    y_loc;
};

</font></font></pre></blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Now, when you read a
tile, it has the location information in it. You simply insert the read
node into the according list in memory. I like the first method better,
though, because it uses less disk space since the encoding only
requires one byte, especially for maps &gt; 255x255 that will need a
short for index reference. I leave the final decision with you, because
there are better ways to implement this, I'm sure.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Now that we
can access the map at arbitrary points from disk, how do we decide what
to store in memory and when to load more? As Greg states, look at the
current map "chunk" as a set of 9 small areas, theoretical boundaries
actually...<br>
<br>
<table align="right" bgcolor="#555555"><tbody><tr><td><img bgcolor="#FFFFFF" src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%205_soubory/mapstructure.gif" alt="Structure of the map" align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
Each small area might represent a 10x10 map chunk. As the player moves
across the middle boundaries, the map data is shifted (scrolled) and
whatever areas are "blank" afterward will be the ones we load from
disk. Refer to Greg's FAQ for more explanation, if you need it.
Hopefully, it is self-evident.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">I will only
say that you must remember to deallocate all nodes no longer needed.
This cannot be over-stated. You will find many, many bugs lurking in
this section of your program if you are not an alert programmer. I
learned this through tedious hours of memory leak chasing. Tedious
hours.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>And What of Our Possessions</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">We come back
to our discussion of the all_items linked list. Since your world may be
exceedingly large (my project included over 400 items at 85%
completion), you will not want to keep this whole list all the time. If
memory allows, sure, keep it in memory for speed. If not, then access
it from disk when needed. Elaboration follows.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Like the
huge map, which only comes into memory in chunks, we only need parts of
the all_items list in memory at any one time. Two reasons: 1) it is far
less space consuming than keeping 1000 items in memory all the time, 2)
it is much quicker when performing operations on the items (ie,
searches, etc).
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Point 2) is
particularly of interest since we will be dealing with those items
closest to the player the most often. Doesn't it make sense to keep
only the necessary items in another list, a "local" list? Of course it
does.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Each time
the player wants to manipulate an item (say, picking up a sword), the
program will have to find the item in question by searching the list.
Then it will have to perform some operation(s) on it (ie, place the
sword in the players possession). This is not to mention the fact that
each graphic update will require searching the list of items to
determine which are visible and which are not. Now this makes perfect
sense, right?
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">So we
establish a secondary linked list: local_items. This list will grow and
shrink as the player moves through the landscape. Items will get moved
to and from this list and the all_items list. all_items will hold items
not currently used. I would recommend holding all_items in memory when
possible for speed issues and issues of altering the game state-- that
is, as related to saved games.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">You see, if
you want to save a game in progress, all object lists must be written
to disk. But if you are constantly writing over the all_items list, and
the computer crashes, that game state is ruined because part of
all_items was in memory, and not all of it was on disk since item in
local_items are literally removed from all_items. Follow?
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">The
solution is to simply store all_items, for game use, in a temporary
copy of the initial game state. That way, all previous information is
preserved and you safely work with a copy. But to avoid all this hocus,
keep the lists in memory at all times, only updating the disk image
when a game is saved. I hope all that soaked in. If not, re-read it in
a couple days.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>Straying From the Path</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">I seem to
have gone off on a few tangents here. But I think that they are all an
integral part of the big picture. Now I would like to address some of
the problems from Greg's FAQ that this framework fixes (I'm not picking
on him, but I am hopefully building on his information), with direct
references to his work.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>III: Walkability</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">To create a
map space that cannot be crossed by the player, simply use the bitflags
to denote a barrier object. This can be either a map_tile, a
npc_object, or an item_object. If any one of these appears in the
location that the player is about to move into, then movement is
restricted. Simple and clean, and no need to make any limitations on
the map or objects.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">In fact, I
divide barriers into several classes. One is a total barrier. Another
only restricts movement-- but not things like arrows or spells flying
across them. Another only restricts arrows and such, but not movement
(for magical sanctuaries). This can all be achieved by using those
simple bitflags in each object structure.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">For those of you who want to see code...

</font></p><blockquote><pre><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#000088" face="Courier New, fixedsys" size="2">
#define flag_BARRIER      (1)            // this blocks movement and missiles
#define flag_MOVEBARRIER  (1&lt;&lt;1)         // block movement only
#define flag_MISSLEBAR    (1&lt;&lt;2)         // block missiles only

</font></font></pre></blockquote>

<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><br>Then, wherever your code handles movement...

</font><blockquote><pre><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#000088" face="Courier New, fixedsys" size="2">
if (map[x][y].bitflags &amp; flag_BARRIER)     // this checks for the bitflag
    player_cant_move();

</font></font></pre></blockquote>

<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><br>Of course, accessing
the map data will involve checking each object in the x,y location list
in question for these flags, but you get the idea.
</font><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>VI: the OBJECT layer</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Greg has no
autonomous objects. His maps hold object information, much like Ultima
4 probably did. With my system, there is no such restriction and no
limitations. You can stack gobs of objects and hordes of people, too,
since they all exist independent of the map data.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2"><font color="#00983e" size="4"><b>So Close, Yet So Far</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">I could go
on typing about different areas of CRPG making for hours, but I want to
limit this document to tile graphics related problems. I should
probably work all of this up into a book and include a demo and tons of
source code, but who would publish it? :) Potential future
installments...
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">Using event
flags to trigger changes in the game world (ie, when a quest is
completed or a decisive action made), the writing of "data compilers"
to create attributes for your objects in a script file (as I did with
my Amiga project), creating a map/object/graphics editor, implementing
a system of spells and using "reagents" to create them, character
creation routines, NPC speech system, NPC artificial intelligence--
especially combat where NPCs intelligently arm themselves based on
circumstances and resources at hand (ie, close range weaponry, spells,
abilities, etc), animating objects. The list goes on. I have experience
programming all of these things, and I plan to put that experience to
use and create a CRPG for the PC. I am in college, so it will come
slowly, but one will emerge. Why don't you explore these subjects with
me, and let's create some good games.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">If there is
sufficient interest, I might write up more technique documents. That
all remains to be seen. Give me your feedback. I want to discuss these
things with people, because nobody seems to want to. I suspect they
fear that people will rip-off their ideas. Let me state a fact,
everyone: technical achievement does not make a great game. If
everything I said here you can do better, you are at no particular
advantage of making a better game than me. The quality lies in content.
So quit worrying about someone stealing your techniques and algorithms,
because even if they did, that doesn't mean they will undermine your
success as a game designer.
</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">SPEAK UP! I would love to hear alternate/better solutions to these programming puzzles.
