<center><span class="title">Tile/Map-Based Game Techniques: Handling Terrain Transitions</span>
<br><span class="author">by <a href="http://www.samugames.com/">David Michael</a></span></center>

<p>This article is another in my series of Tile/Map-based Game
Techniques. In this article I discuss a method for handling terrain
transitions on your main map display.</p>
<p>First off, by "terrain" I am referring to the background or base
layer of graphics for the map display. Terrain might refer to normal
terrain types, such as grasslands or forests, but it is not limited to
this. In a science-fiction game, for instance, the terrain could be
bare metal or even the landscape features of another planet.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>The problem of terrain transitioning grows out of the need for a
single type of terrain to be able to mesh with itself and still look
good when placed next to another terrain. A forest tile should fit
together with other forest tiles so that the forest proceeds seamlessly
from one map cell to the next. But what happens when the forest tile is
placed next to another type of terrain, such as mountains or grassland?
Without some form "transitioning" the map looks very blocky and
artificial.</p>
<p><span class="maintext-1"><b>Figure 1: Terrain Without Transitions</b>
<br><dir><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%209_soubory/TerrainTransitionExample.gif" border="0" height="148" width="148"></dir><br></span>
</p><p>One solution to the problem is to create specialized transition
tiles that "blend" sections of each terrain into a single tile.
However, the need for all terrains to transition into any other means
that the number of specialized tiles escalates quickly. It may not be
obvious at first glance, but the number of transitions required even
between just 2 terrain types is quite large. On a square grid, there
are 8 possible points of transition: one for each side and one for each
corner. Even the simple forest-to-grassland transition would require
256 transitions, and this would have to be done for each terrain
transition combination. If you have 9 or 10 terrain types, the amount
of graphics this approach would require is unworkable.</p>
<p>This can be refined some by using transitions with a transparent
element, allowing for more variety with fewer tiles. The forest
transitions would then be able to overlap any terrain. But 256
transition variations for each terrain type still seems pretty
excessive.</p>
<p>So how do you trim down the number of required transition graphics to a number that is more manageable? This is how we did it.</p>

<h1>Our Solution</h1>
<p>The first part of our solution was to assign a "precedence" to the
various terrain types. By precedence, I mean that when two different
terrain types meet, one of them invariably "overlaps" the other. In the
example of forest meeting grassland, if forest has a higher precedence
(and it should) then it will always overlap the grassland.</p>
<p>In Artifact, we used the following terrain precedence (listed
highest to lowest): jungle, forest, mountain, hill, swamp, deserts,
grassland, water (open water or river). Please note that this
precedence does not reflect the relative elevations of the terrain but
is instead based on which terrains looks best when overlapping other
terrains.</p>
<p><span class="maintext-1"><b>Figure 2: Artifact Terrain Precedence</b>
<br><dir><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%209_soubory/TerrainTransitionPrecedence.gif" border="0" height="48" width="432"></dir><br></span>

</p><p>The next step was to reduce the number of terrain transition
variations from 256. This number can be cut drastically by separating
the "edge" transitions and the "corner" transitions. As it was pointed
out above, a single terrain cell has 8 points of transition: one for
each side and one for each corner. Thus, there are only 16 possible
edge transitions, and 16 possible corner transitions. By using
combinations of edge and corner transitions you can create all of the
necessary 256 variations with only 32 total tiles. This is a huge
reduction in graphics required.</p>
<p>The template we used followed a binary format. For the edges, west
was considered "bit 0", north was "bit 1", and east and south were "bit
2" and "bit 3", respectively. Similarly for the corners, the northwest
corner was "bit 0", the northeast corner "bit 1", and so on. How we
arranged the actual terrain transition graphics is demonstrated in
Figure 3. If you think of the covered edges as 1 and the non-covered
edges as 0, you can see that the columns proceed in normal binary
manner: 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, and so on.</p>
<p><span class="maintext-1"><b>Figure 3: Terrain Transition Template</b>
<br><dir><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%209_soubory/TerrainTransitionTemplate.gif" border="0" height="63" width="483"></dir><br></span>
</p><p>Figure 4 shows how this was applied to create the grassland transitions in Artifact.</p>
<p><span class="maintext-1"><b>Figure 4: Artifact Grassland Transitions</b>
<br><dir><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%209_soubory/ArtifactGrasslandTransitions.gif" border="0" height="75" width="593"></dir><br></span>
</p><p>With this method drawing the map is now a 2-step process. For
each map cell, the base terrain must be drawn, and then any transitions
that overlay it in reverse order of precedence (lowest precedence drawn
first). However, the reduction in graphics required more than makes up
for the additional work. Also, since the transition graphics are mostly
transparent, the actual "work" involved is less than it might seem.</p>
<p>Using the precedence established earlier, and the bit assignments
for the edges and corners, calculating which transitions you need in a
particular map cell is relatively straightforward. Essentially, for
each map cell, you check all adjacency possibilities for terrain types
that overlap the terrain of the cell. The transition information for a
single terrain type need only use 8-bits of data (4 bits for the edges
and 4 bits for the corners) which fits conveniently into a single byte.
Thus, the total terrain transition information for Artifact's 9 terrain
types requires only 9 bytes per map cell.</p>
<p>You can pre-calculate the transition information and store it with
the map, or you can calculate it "on the fly" at runtime. For rendering
Artifact's map display, I calculate the transitions for the visible
portion of the map only. This reduces the amount of storage required
since only a small portion of the map is visible at one time.</p>
<p>A quick example: To calculate the transitions needed for a hill
terrain, you need only consider any adjacent jungles, forests, and
mountains, since those are the only terrain types that have a higher
precedence. Figure 5 demonstrates the overlapping of transitions on the
base terrain graphics, with a hill as the center terrain.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>With a bit of preparation in the graphics and a few tricks during
the rendering, you can achieve professional-looking terrain transitions
in your game. While drawing the map becomes a bit more complicated, the
reduction in graphics required and the flexibility of the system more
than make up for that.</p>
