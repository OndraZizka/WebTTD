<h1>What are Isometric Tiles?</h1>
<p>Isometric tiles are diamond shaped pictures that can be combined
with other isometric tiles to form a seamless landscape for tile-based
games. Due to its diamond shape, the isometric tile gives the illusion
of depth.

</p><h1>Isometric Tile Dimensions</h1>

<p>At first glance of a normal isometric tile image, you think that
there are only two dimension, a width and a height. This is not totally
true. Although the image does actually have only 2 dimensions (width
and height) the tile image represents a 3 dimensional space and thus it
needs to be described using 3 dimensions: Length, Width, and Height. A
first this will be a bit confusing to remember. Don't worry. It will
eventually become more natural as you work with isometric tiles.
</p><p>The picture to the right shows the isometric tile with its dimensions described.<br>
<img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%203_soubory/tile_dimensions.gif" align="right">
</p><ul>
   <li>Length:  The leftmost point of the tile to the rightmost point of the tile.</li>
   <li>Width:
The farthest point of the tile from the screen to the closest point of
the tile to the screen. This is probably the most confusing dimension
of isometric tiles.</li>
   <li>Height:  The 'altitude' or thickness of the tile.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h1>Drawing isometric tiles</h1>
<p>Since an isometric tile isn't a nice rectangular shape, a simple
bitblt will not work. What needs to be done is a transparent bitblt
needs to be performed. If the method you are using to bitblt the tile
does not support transparent bitblt'ing, then a mask of the tile being
bitblt is needed. The steps needed to bitblt the tile are as follows:
</p><ol>
   <li>You need the picture of the tile and a picture of a mask of the tile.<br>
   <img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%203_soubory/tile_and_mask.gif" align="right">
   In the picture to the right, the white background of the tile image is the transparent portion of the image.</li>   <li>Bitblt
the mask using the OR operator. For windows, this is the SRCPAINT
raster operation (ROP). This will create a sort of 'cookie cutout'
where the part where the image will be is white.</li>
   <li>Bitblt
the actual image using the AND operator. For Windows, this is the
SRCAND raster operation (ROP). This will place the image onto the
cutout without damaging any surrounding images.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>The actual shape of the mask is up to you. The mask shown in the
picture above allows the entire image of the tile to come through.</p><p><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%203_soubory/top_and_side.gif" align="right">Things
get a bit trickier if you just want the top portion of the tile to
show. No longer can simply just bitblt a mask and image because the
second bitblt will damage the surrounding graphics. This is one
drawback to having 3 dimensions. A solution to this drawback is to have
the tile sides as a seperate image. This means more bitblt'ing but more
flexiblity also. If you need the top of the tile refreshed, but not the
sides then you can do that if you have the tile in two images.</p>

<h1>Isometric Tile Layering</h1>
<p>In order to get a smooth transition from one type of tile/terrain to
another tile/terrain, 'fringe' layers need to be applied. Fringe layers
are simply flat tile images (no sides) that are drawn on top of a tile
for a smooth transition effect. Bellow is an example of the application
of a fringe to a border of grass and stone. Of course a better artist
could make the fringe look even better by applying a little dirt on the
side and better colors.</p>
<p><table width="100%">
   <tbody><tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%203_soubory/fringe_tiles.gif"></td>
      <td align="center"><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%203_soubory/fringe_example.gif"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td align="center"><span class="maintext-1">Tiles used to draw the image.  Third tile is a fringe tile.</span></td>
      <td align="center"><span class="maintext-1">Small example of a fringe.</span></td>   </tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>This example is not the best example but it will do. The way the
the fringe layer is applied is the same way the stone tile is drawn.
First the stone tile is drawn (mask and then image) and then the fringe
is drawn at the same point (mask and then image). This gives the
illusion that the grass is invading the cracks of the stone. (Well it's
suppose to if the art work was better :) )</p><p>Layer upon layer can
be applied to a tile. There is a drawback, of course. The more layers
you add to the tile, the slower the drawing of the map will be since it
needs to bitblt over and over again. Layering is nice and I recommend
it... but don't go overboard.</p>

<h1>Variable Tile Heights and Tile Base</h1>
<p>An isometric tile occupies a three dimensional space. There is no
rule that all tiles in a set of tiles (or tileset) need to be the same
height. Having variable height tiles is actually a nice feature to
have. Let's take our stone tile for instance. The first image of the
tile has a height of 9 pixels. There is no rule that says that our
grass tile needs to be the same height as the stone tile. Actually,
making the tiles different heights by a pixel or two will make the
landscape look even more realistic.</p>
<p>In order to be able to draw tiles with variable heights properly, we
need to know where is the base for this tile. What's the tile base? The
tile base is simply the offset from the tile top (the maximum height
value) to the point in the tile where the tile is flush with the
ground. The image bellow shows an example of 3 tiles with different
heights and how they are drawn next to each other using the tile base
as a sort of guide line.</p>

<table width="100%">
   <tbody><tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%203_soubory/var_height.gif"></td>
      <td align="center"><img src="Isometric%20Rendering%20Howto%203_soubory/var_height_example.gif"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td align="center"><span class="maintext-1">3 tiles with different heights.  The purple line is the tile base for that tile.</span></td>
      <td align="center"><span class="maintext-1">The 3 tiles drawn next to each other with the tile bases lined up.</span></td>
   </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>When drawing tiles with a tile base other than 0, simply move the
tile up on the Y coordinate prior to the bitblt and then bitblt at that
point. Here's a sample C/C++ code to do that:</p>

<blockquote><pre><div class="code">
void DrawTile(char TileID, long DestX, long DestY, char BaseOffset){
    //Initializing stuff

    DestY -= BaseOffset;    //Move the tile up the Y axis to take into
                            //account the tile base.

    //Actual bitblt call
}

</div></pre></blockquote>

<p>It's actually very easy to implement. One very nice thing about
variable height tiles is that it doesn't take away that much processing
power to do unlike the bitblt'ing done above.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>That is the quick and slightly confusing story of isometric tiles
from my point-of-view. All of these ideas have been developed with a
particular map engine in mind but the ideas should be abstract enough
to be useful in any map engine. If you have any questions about this
article, feel free to contact me (See above). I am willing to help
anyone who asks nicely. If I don't respond right away, don't get mad...
I'm probably just busy or away. I'll always respond to tell you I got
your email.
</p><p>Good Luck.</p>
