13:12	OndraZizka	WebTTD? http://ondra.zizka.cz/stranky/programovani/web_javascript_ajax_canvas/webttd.texy
13:12	Pikka	Eddi: I'm british/australian, we say aluminium too
13:13	SmatZ	OndraZizka: good luck :-)
13:14	OndraZizka	SmatZ: Hereby I'm looking for co-programmers :)
13:14	SmatZ	hehe ;)
13:14	SmatZ	good luck with looking for co-programmers :)
13:15	OndraZizka	Thanks :) Are some devs here? I've just few technical questions
13:15	SmatZ	some, yes
13:15	Eddi|zuHause	ask the questions, they don't necessarily require a dev at all
13:15	Rubidium	I've heard Pikka is some dev :)
13:16	SpComb	hardly a clone
13:16	SpComb	perhaps an MMOified version
13:19	OndraZizka	SpComb: Yes, that's more accurate
13:19		*** Chris_Booth joined #openttd
13:19	OndraZizka	"WebTTD - browser-based Transport Tycoon derivate" ;-)
13:21	Eddi|zuHause	but that abbreviates to "bbTTd" :p
13:22		*** worldemar quit (Quit: worldemar)
13:22		*** worldemar joined #openttd
13:22	SpComb	so change it to 'WebTTD - A Browser-based ...' :P
13:23	SpComb	hmm, I've seen a couple isometric-2D web frontends some time
13:23	SpComb	someone on this channel wrote something that had landscape
13:23	andythenorth	yay, done some more of the stupid boats :P
13:23	SpComb	can't remember who it was... TrueBrain?
13:23	Eddi|zuHause	i believe that was TrueBrain
13:23	Pikka	hooray for stupid boats!
13:24	TrueBrain	I never wrote that; I did it for WebDUNE. The one you refer to had a very nice prototype
13:24	SpComb	well, I recall something that looked very much like TTD
13:25		*** Lakie joined #openttd
13:25	TrueBrain	wasn't me :)
13:26	TrueBrain	Well, all I did once was push via PNGs to a web screenshots of the game ... but I never published any screenshots of it :p (as it failed badly)
13:26	SpComb	I had the realtime scrolly-tiles thing, but it was just a hack
13:27	SmatZ	hmmm... directory called "P"... I wonder what it contains...
13:27	TrueBrain	I did that for Webdune ;) Ghehe :) It even had a Quad running in the map :p
13:27	SmatZ	OH GOD!
13:28		Rubidium wonders what SmatZ's rambling about
13:28	SmatZ	content of that directory was quite explicit and hardcore :-p
13:29	TrueBrain	so you found your porn back on your own disk?
13:29	TrueBrain	good for you!
13:29	SmatZ	not my disk :-p
13:29	TrueBrain	isn't that what they all say?
13:29		SmatZ is gone for few hours... this notebook needs detailed examination...
13:30	TrueBrain	enjoy
13:30	Rubidium	*too* much detail
13:30	TrueBrain	Rubidium: no, that would be when he gives the link to his webcam
13:30	Eddi|zuHause	by examination i hope you mean "dd"
13:30	SmatZ	;-)
13:33	TrueBrain	Eddi|zuHause: rsync is more useful in this case
13:34	SpComb	storing porn in a TrueCrypt volume is good for society as a whole
13:35	OndraZizka	SpComb: realtime scrolly-tiles thing, that sounds interesting, do you still have it?
13:35	SmatZ	-"in a TrueCrypt volume "
13:36	OndraZizka	TrueBrain: Do you still have that prototype?
13:36	SpComb	OndraZizka: I mean, it was just tiled screenshots from OpenTTD, nothing more
13:36	OndraZizka	SpComb: Aha :)
13:36	SpComb	but there has been prior work on actually constructing the isometric tiles with javascript/HTML, I can distinctly remember at least two instances
13:39	OndraZizka	SpComb: I have coded that already,
13:39	OndraZizka	even with elevations
13:40	OndraZizka	but, I can't figure out how to tell which tile was clicked...
13:40	OndraZizka	(for that elevated model)
13:40	SpComb	well, math :)
13:41	OndraZizka	Well, not math :) rather a pixel depth-map
13:41	OndraZizka	There are buildings etc...
13:41	OndraZizka	generally, sprites.
13:43	andythenorth	hmmm....I could really use a collaborator for FISH :|
13:43		*** thepalm quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.85 [Firefox 3.5.3/20090824101458])
13:43	Pikka	to do what, andy?
13:43	andythenorth	a little bit of drawing, and a little bit of coding
13:43	andythenorth	example: I've added ferries.
13:44	andythenorth	They could do with a loaded state. Buses for example
13:44	andythenorth	Which can be had from eGRVTS
13:44	andythenorth	but the ferries also refit to other cargos
13:44	Eddi|zuHause	OndraZizka: there is a calculation for which tile is clicked in the game code
13:44	andythenorth	so I need alternatives sprites with trucks
13:44	andythenorth	that's 20 minutes of drawing and 20 mins of code
13:44	andythenorth	I guess without a collaborator FISH will never have all the little tweaks that make a lovely set
13:45	Pikka	I dunno, it seems to be coming along quite nicely :)
13:46	TrueBrain	[13:36] <OndraZizka> TrueBrain: Do you still have that prototype? <- I have my working prototype somewhere, but it is based on a older version of Django, so it doesn't want to boot :p Besides, because it used Python to access a 2D array, it was DEAD slow :p
13:46	OndraZizka	Eddi|zuHause: Well, that's what I wanted to ask, how it's done in OpenTTD. Are you sure it's a calculation, not a pixel map?
13:47	Eddi|zuHause	i'm fairly sure it's a calculation
13:47	OndraZizka	Eddi|zuHause: Ok, and by any chance, do you know which code does this?
13:47	OndraZizka	(svn link at best)
13:48	Eddi|zuHause	no, but there can't be that many places that do screen<->map coordinate transformations
13:48	TrueBrain	it depends on the object ... you can never press on a tile, that has no action
13:48	TrueBrain	clicking vehicles, labels, .. have effect
13:49	Eddi|zuHause	TrueBrain: it's not about the actions, for example tile highlighting needs this transformation, too
13:49	OndraZizka	TrueBrain: Has an action, if you're e.g. in railway building mode, right?
13:49	OndraZizka	So then you need to know the tile
13:49	andythenorth	oops my nfo crashed the game
13:50	andythenorth	(embarassed)
13:50	Alberth	OndraZizka: simplest approach may be to follow the terrain tile by tile towards the coords of the mouse
13:50	TrueBrain	tilehighlight_* might help you with highlights
13:50		*** Lakie quit (Quit: bbl)
13:51	OndraZizka	Alberth: Perhaps, but if it was not a bunch of <div>s
13:51	OndraZizka	...thus, rectangles
13:51	Alberth	2 triangles
13:52	OndraZizka	hm, that sounds promisingly
13:52	TrueBrain	for OpenTTD, most of the conversion is done in VpSelectTilesWithMethod() I believe
13:52	OndraZizka	Well I could actually ignore buildings etc, store a set of triangles upon drawing, and then compute the tile from the coords
13:52	OndraZizka	(by searching these triangles0
13:52	OndraZizka	)
13:53	TrueBrain	I would suggest to put a <div> at a very high z, and record mousemovement on that (and make it transparent, of course)
13:53	TrueBrain	that makes it simple javascript to calculate placement
13:53	OndraZizka	TrueBrain: That's what I do
13:53	OndraZizka	I thing google maps and similar do that too.
